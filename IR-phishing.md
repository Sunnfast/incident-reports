# Incident Response Report - Phishing
A short incident response report derived from a fictious scenario where I must investigate a phishing alert as a SOC analyst. This report was part of the coursework for the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

### Scenario [excerpt]
You are a level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. Previously, you received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. After investigating the email attachment file's hash, the attachment has already been verified malicious. Now that you have this information, you must follow your organization's process to complete your investigation and resolve the alert.
