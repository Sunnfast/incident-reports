# Incident Response Report - Phishing
A short incident response report derived from a fictious scenario where I must investigate a phishing alert as a SOC analyst. This report was part of the coursework for the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate.

### Scenario [excerpt]
You are a level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. Previously, you received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. After investigating the email attachment file's hash, the attachment has already been verified malicious. Now that you have this information, you must follow your organization's process to complete your investigation and resolve the alert.

## Evaluation
* Alert Severity: Medium - there is a risk of compromise as the user that received the email may have opened the attachment.
* Sender Details: The sender's name on the email is "Def Communications," however the email address itself looks significantly different from this name ("76tguyhh6tgftrt7tg.su"). This may indicate that the sender is attempting to impersonate Def Communications to pose as a trusted entity.
* Message Body: Contains grammatical errors are littered throughout the message body, thus pointing to this email being less legitimate and more likely to be a phishing email.
* Attachments: 


## Conclusion
